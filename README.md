# Andrei Sager Online Portfolio

To be honest, this is my fourth portfolio. The first one got deleted and I didn't know how to use version control software, the second one was bloated from Sass for a relatively small project, and the last was just too ugly.

This app focuses on showcasing everything about my career. This includes things about me, my experiences, my projects, and contact information.
